What does PCB-GCODE-WIZARD do?

It is for people who want to mill their own PCBs using a CNC machine.

It is a 3-step process:
(Step 1) Design the PCB schematic and layout using Eagle.
(Step 2) Run the PCBGCODE.ULP from John Johnson to generate the raw CNC gcode file.
	 See www.pcbgcode.org to download version 3.5.2.11.
(Step 3) Read the raw gcode file into PCB-GCODE-WIZARD to view and verify it, and generate an optimized gcode file.

There are two types of optimization featured:
(1) Elimination of redundant milling paths to greatly reduce total milling times.
(2) G00 Rapid travel optimization for minimum distance.

#2 above can also be used to minimize G00 Rapid travel during drilling operations, although some manual editing of the raw gcode file is necessary to split milling and drilling info.


PCB-GCODE-WIZARD can be purchased using Paypal, see website for details.
Current version is v101, please ignore obsolete demo version 100 which was previously posted on Cadsoft downloads page.
